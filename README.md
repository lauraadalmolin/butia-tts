Following instructions from https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/master/notebooks/Benchmark.ipynb

It is possible to set some configurations manually in the code, for testing.
 
You only need to paste the following lines after the config file paths:

~~~
CONFIG.windowing = False
CONFIG.prenet_dropout = False
CONFIG.separate_stopnet = True
CONFIG.stopnet = True
~~~
